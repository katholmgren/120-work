# Final Project Proposal

## Proposal

For my project, I want to create a basic shooter game. It will be a robot that shoots lasers at aliens. If you hit an alien, you get points. If you run into an alien, you lose.

## Inspiration

This is very similar to the game Asteroids, which is a shooter game that has a rocket shooting at asteroids.

## Similar Projects

Asteroids, Space Invaders, and other Atari games are all similar my project. The p5 keyIsDown reference page also looks similar to the third person shooter I will be making. 

## New Technology and Potential Problems

I will have to use keyIsDown and maybe other key pressed functions which are all new to me. From the p5 Reference page, keyIsDown can move an object around the canvas. I would try using the same function for the space bar shooter, but I'm unsure which key pressed function would work best for the shooter.

I have a feeling that some of the object interaction is going to trip me up. When the laser hits an alien, the alien will splice. When an alien collides with the robot, the robot will splice and the game will be over.

I also don't know how to make the game start over when this happens. Maybe I will have a click to start over screen that will show up when you lose.

## Basic Work Plan

The due date is May 8th, which is in a while, but I also have a lot of homework these next couple weeks. I'll work on it a lot this weekend, trying to get the basics functioning. I'll probably start working on the robot shooter Class first, trying to get it to move forward with the forward arrow and rotate with the side arrows. Then I'll work on the laser, then the aliens, then the object interaction next Monday-Thursday. I expect I'll run into problems with the object interaction, so I'll plan on going to lab on Thursday the third. Then when I clear all that up, I'll work on the aesthetics more. Then something else will probably go wrong and I'll talk to Emily about it. Then I'll be done on the 7th probably.

## Current Progress

I researched some online shooter games and played them a lot instead of studying which was fun. I also looked up the key pressed functions to see which one would work best. I looked at the code on the reference page behind each of these functions to see if I could do it. It will be a good resource for me as I work. I also looked up images of potential characters that I could use. That's all I have done so far.
